Simple MailChimp oAuth API package for Laravel 5.+. **Note, this package is designed for applications that require users to authenticate via oAuth and handle requests on their behalf. Developed specifcally for [gethulahoop.com](https://www.gethulahoop.com), but available for anyone to use freely!**

It's not perfect and can use some refinement. More to come.

**_Documentation coming soon. Refer to source functions for now._**
